# Notes on **Coding Logic**

- [Points to remember:](#points-to-remember)

## Points to remember:
- First improve the concepts, then start participating in coding contests, hackathons, etc.
- Think before coding. Thinking should constitute `80%` of the entire process.
    - Read the question thoroughly, check what all information has been given.
    - Solve the problem using pen & paper.
    - Dry run the logic for a few sample inputs.
    - Check for any edge cases that may occur.
- Use a step-by-step approach to solve the question/problem statement.
    - First, devise a solution using `Brute Force` approach. -> `Least optimised code`
    - Next, try to reduce the time complexity. Try switching to a more efficient data structure -> `Time optimised code`
    - Finally, try to reduce the space complexity -> `Time + Space optimised code`
- Practice: Don't go 3 days without coding. Code for atleast `1 hour` each day.
- Ideal time to move on from the problem (Company Expectations):
    - Easy: `5-10 minutes`
    - Medium: `15-20 minutes`
    - Hard: `40-60 minutes`
- Solve puzzles, they help to develop the logic.
