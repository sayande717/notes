# Basics

## Network Types
- Based on Distance, the network types are:
    - PAN: Personal Area Network
    - LAN: Local Area Network
    - CAN: Campus Area Network
    - MAN: Metropolitan Area Network
    - WAN: Wide Area Network
- As distance increases, the number of devices used also increases, and we also have to put repeaters or network extenders to ensure the signal is strong enough to reach the destination.
- As distance increases, the error rates & maintainence cost also increases.

## OSI Model

### Why?
- There are a lot of functionalities and protocols that are necessary to send data from the client to the server, or vice versa.
- OSI is a theoritical model, ie it is not implemented in real life. But, using this model, all the other models are developed.
- OSI Model defines the layers in a network system, how the protocols are implemented in each layer, and how they work together to achieve it's primary purpose of moving data from Point A to Point B.

### Layers
- Application
- Presentation
- Session
- Transport
- Network
- Data Link
- [Physical](#physical-layer)

### Difference vs TCP/IP Model

- TCP/IP layer is an implementable model.
- It was a protocol defined by ARPANET for use by them.

- It combines the `Application, Presentation & Session layer` into the `Application Layer`.
- The `Network Layer` is defined as the `Internet Layer`.
- It combines the `Data Link Layer & Physical Layer` into `Network Access Layer`.

## Physical Layer
- Deals with hardware.
- Isn't concerned with security, that part is handled by the software.

### Cables & Connectors
### Physical Topologies
### Networking hardware
### Transmission modes
### Multiplexing
### Encoding
