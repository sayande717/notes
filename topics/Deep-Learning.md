## Feed-Forward Neural Network
- A feed-forward neural network is an artificial neural network where the connections between the nodes do not form a cycle. It is the simplest type of artificial neural network and consists of layers of neurons, where each layer is fully connected to the next one. Information moves in one directionâ€”from the input layer, through the hidden layers, to the output layer. This type of network is typically used for tasks such as classification and regression.
- Formula to compute the weighted sum: $z = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i . w_{ij} + b_j$
    - $x_i$: Input i, $w_{ij}$: Weight from input i to hidden layer j, $b_j$: Bias for hidden node $j$.
