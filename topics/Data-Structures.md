# Basics
- Data Structures intend to organize data, which makes processing easier.
- 2 Types: 
    - Linear: Elements are arranged sequentially.
        > Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue
    - Non-Linear: Elements are not arranged sequentially. They are stored in multiple levels.
        > Tree, Graph
- Algorithms: check [here](./Algorithms.md)
