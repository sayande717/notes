## Artificial Language
### Type 1
1. Here are some words translated from an artificial language.
`gorblflur` means `fan belt`
`pixngorbl` means `ceiling fan`
`arthtusl` means `tile roof`
Which word could mean "ceiling tile"?
- gorbl: fan
- pixn: ceiling
- arth: tile
- So, the word is `pixnarth`.

### Type 2
1. Here are some words translated from an artificial language.
`slar` means `jump`
`slary` means `jumping`
`slarend` means `jumped`
Which word could mean "playing"?
- y: ing
- end: ed
- So the word is `clargy`.

## Analogies

## Logical Games - Discussion
1. Five roommates Randy, Sally, Terry, Uma, and Vernon each do one housekeeping task mopping, sweeping, laundry, vacuuming, or dusting one day a week, Monday through Friday.
    - Vernon does not vacuum and does not do his task on Tuesday.
    - Sally does the dusting, and does not do it on Monday or Friday.
    - The mopping is done on Thursday.
    - Terry does his task, which is not vacuuming, on Wednesday.
    - The laundry is done on Friday, and not by Uma.
    - Randy does his task on Monday.
    - What task does Terry do on Wednesday?
    - Here, Terry does his task on Wesnesday. Sally does the **dusting**, **mopping** is done one Thursday, **laundry** is done on friday, and **Terry does not vacuum**. So, in the end, **only mopping** is left to be done by Terry.


# Verbal Reasoning
## Syllogism
### Type 1
1. Some actors are singers. All the singers aredancers. Conclusion:
    ```diff
    + Some actors are dancers.
    - No singer is actor.
    ```

1. All cars are cats. All fans are cats. Conclusion:
    ```diff
    - All cars are fans.
    - Some fans are cars. 
    ```
    <img src="../assets/images/Aptitude/self/1.png" alt="Syllogism 2" width="200px" />
1. All the research scholars are psychologists. Some psychologists are scientists. Conclusion:
    ```diff
    - All the research scholars are scientists.
    - Some research scholars are scientists.
    + Some scientists are psychologists. 
    + Some psychologists are research scholars.
    ```

## Logical Sequence of Words
1. Newly married Couple, Family, Caste, Clan, Species
    - Relation: Belongs to
1. Si Units of measurement: 
    - Exa ($10^{18}$)
    - Peta ($10^{15}$)
    - Tera ($10^{12}$)
    - Giga ($10^{9}$)
    - Mega ($10^{6}$)
    - Kilo ($10^{3}$)
    - Hecto ($10^{2}$)
    - Deca ($10^{1}$)
    - Unit ($10^{0}$)
    - Deci ($10^{-1}$)
    - Centi ($10^{-2}$)
    - Milli ($10^{-3}$)
    - Micro ($10^{-6}$)
    - Nano ($10^{-9}$)
    - Pico ($10^{-12}$)

## Analogy
1. Carbon:Diamond::Corundum:Ruby, is used in making
1. Eye:Myopia::Teeth:Pyorrhoea, can have disease
1. Cassock:Priest::Gown:Graduate, is worn by
1. CEDH:HDEC::????:PNRV, reverse order
1. DFHJ:LNPR::TVXZ:????, D -> L: +8, while D->F,F->H,H->J: +2. So, move forward 8 steps from T, then keep adding +2.

## Arithmetic Reasoning
1. A girl counted in the following way on the fingers of her left hand : She started by calling the thumb 1, the index finger 2, middle finger 3, ring finger 4, little finger 5 and then reversed direction calling the ring finger 6, middle finger 7 and so on. She counted upto 1994. She ended counting on which finger?
    - If we take the thumb, then the numbers are counted like: $1,9,17,25$, etc.
    - The equation is $8n+1$, n starts from 0.
    - So, $8n+1=1994$, $n=249(+1)$. So, she counts till 1 finger after the thumb, ie the index finger.
1. What is the product of all the numbers in the dial of a telephone?
    - The digit `0` is included among the dial, so the product is `0`.

## Direction Sense
1. Golu started from his house towards North. After covering a distance of 8 km. he turned towards left and covered a distance of 6 km. What is the shortest distance now from his house?
    - The shortest distance is the hypotenuse of the triangle. $\sqrt {8^2+6^2}$
1. One evening before sunset Rekha and Hema were talking to each other face to face. If Hema's shadow was exactly to the right of Hema, which direction was Rekha facing?
    - If Hema's shadow was to the right of Hema, it means the sun was on the left of both of them.
    - Rekha was facing the South direction.
1. One morning Udai and Vishal were talking to each other face to face at a crossing. If Vishal's shadow was exactly to the left of Udai, which direction was Udai facing?
    - The sun is to the right of both of them. So this is the east direction.
    - If Vishal's shadow is to the left of Uday, it can only happen when Uday is facing the North and Vishal is facing the South.
